Update the `timeit` documentation based on discussion in issue #42765.

Resolve Issue #42765

This issue discusses the documentation for the `timeit.Timer` class, as well as
possible improvements. `elibendersky` provided a patch to update the
documentation, and `rurpy` improved on this in a post. This merge request
implements `rurpy`'s version of the `timeit.Timer` class documentation with some
light edits.

The goal of this documentation change is to better explain how to use
`timeit.Timer`, what the input arguments are, and how the args are use to
actually time the execution of the provided snippet.
